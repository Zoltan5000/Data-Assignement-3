<p>A handful of counties in New York State have announced they won't be following New York Governor Kathy Hochuls new statewide mask mandate that went into effect Monday.
</p>
<p>Hochuls new mandate requires masks be worn in all businesses or that businesses then instate a vaccine requirement. The governor announced the mandate would be reassessed on Jan 15th.
</p>
<p>Hochul left the enforcement of the mandate up to the counties, leaving some counties choosing not to enforce the governor's order at all.

<p>This new measure comes as states across the U.S try to slow the spread of the new Omicron Covid-19 variant. On Wednesday alone, New York hit more than 18,000 cases, a single day total not seen since January of 2021.
</p>
<p>“I think a big takeaway here is the Omicron is indeed a ‘variant of concern’ and it appears to render Covid-19 vaccines less effective against infection,” said Lauren Rauh a Senior Program Manager for CUNY Graduate School Of Public Health’s CONVINCE USA, a research and communication strategy initiative aiming to create support for COVID-19 immunization and its science.
</p>
<p>Rauh quoted Public Health professor Melissa Hawkins, who on Wednesday wrote an article for the non profit news site The Conversation, saying “The preliminary data about omicron and vaccines is coming in quickly and is revealing lower vaccine effectiveness. Best estimates suggest vaccines are around 30%-40% effective at preventing infections and 70% effective at preventing severe disease.”
</p>
<p>On Thursday, Hochul ramped up warnings about the new Covid-19 variant, ​​“This is a public health crisis. We must not make light of the winter surge that we are facing” Hochul told New Yorkers to “get vaccinated, get the booster and wear a mask.”
</p>
<p>Rauh echoed the Governors words, stressing that “Masking indoors in public continues to remain an important layer of protection to prevent illness and mitigate further spread of the virus. Booster shots are also more important than ever.”
